# Permutation and Combination
Basic implementation of Permutation and Combination using math package in Python. 

## Combination
Combination is a method of counting. Order ,in this case, does not matter.

## Permutation 
Permutation is a method of counting. Order ,in this case, matters.

## Fruit for Thought
Number order in a Combination Lock matters (ie: 1234 != 4321). Therefore, should it be called a Combination Lock or a Permutation Lock?
